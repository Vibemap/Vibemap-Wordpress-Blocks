        "description": "Platinum-selling rock band Falling In Reverse, lead by outspoken and charismatic singer Ronnie Radke, have been completely dominating the radio and streaming space in this new decade. The band, which formed back in 2008 and built itself as a mainstay of the Warped Tour scene while gracing many Alternative Press covers, has seen its latest single \"Zombified\" hit No. 1 Billboard's Hot Hard Rock Songs Chart.The band has also been generating nearly 50 million total streams per month. Falling In Reverse's previous chart-topping single \"Popular Monster\" earned platinum RIAA status. The track is truly a juggernaut and is a watershed moment for the band. \"Popular Monster\" has been streamed nearly half-a-billion times and has emerged as one of the biggest anthems of the past several years. It enjoyed a multi-week stint at No. 1 on the rock radio charts, landing in the top spot on the Mediabase Active Rock Chart, Billboard's Hot Hard Rock Chart, and the Nielsen Rock Chart, and marked the first No.1 single of the band's career. It followed the gold certification of the band's 2011-released debut album The Drug in Me Is You and a sold-out anniversary tour. During the shutdown that was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Radke quickly established himself as one of the most popular musicians streaming on the Twitch platform.\nIn Winter 2022, the band returned to the road and embarked on the sold-out \"Live From the Unknown\" tour, further cementing its status as one of the top live draws in the genre. Falling In Reverse have continued to catch the eye of the press, with their career arc being spotlighted by top-tier, tastemaking publications such as Forbes, Billboard, New York Times, Pitchfork, and beyond.",

        "description": "The Man in Chair, a musical theatre fan, greets the audience from his current-day NYC apartment, sharing that he is feeling a bit depressed. The best way to lift his mood, he decides, is to listen to his favorite cast album, The Drowsy Chaperone, a Jazz Age musical full of fun, clich\u00e9s, and dancing from the Roaring 20s. The characters come to life in the Man's apartment as he continues to narrate and interact with the cast and the audience. The show-within-a-show begins as guests arrive at the estate of Mrs. Tottendale for the imminent 1928 wedding of the famous Janet Van de Graaf to the wealthy Robert Martin. Janet's decision to marry Robert means that she will stop performing, of course, so the producer and gangster investors plot to stop the wedding. Other guests include the overworked Best Man, a Latin Lover, a daring aviatrix, and the Drowsy Chaperone, who continually sips from a flask, smuggled in during Prohibition. Hilarious situations, off and on again marriage plans, and a happy ending bring the Man in Chair his antidote to his blue mood, and he shares his glee with the audience.",

        "description": "Get tickets here\u00a0\nJOHN LODGE,\u00a0legendary bass player, songwriter and vocalist of\u00a0The Moody Blues\u00a0and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, has announced that he will be bringing his incredible new show\u00a0\u201cPerforms Days of Future Passed\u201d\u00a0to the Mid-West and West Coast of the USA in July.\u00a0JOHN,\u00a0together with his\u00a010,000 Light Years Band, will perform\u00a0The Moody Blues\u2019 groundbreaking album,\u00a0Days of Future Passed, in its entirety with a special recording by the late\u00a0Graeme Edge\u00a0and performances by\u00a0Jon Davison\u00a0of\u00a0YES. The show will also feature a first half set of Moody Blues\u2019 classics, including all of John\u2019s hits, \u201cRide My See-Saw\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)\u201d, \u201cIsn\u2019t Life Strange\u201d, to name just a few, plus tributes to all his band mates, as he continues in his quest to \u2018keep all the Moody Blues music alive\u2019.Days of Future Passed\u00a0celebrated its 55th\u00a0Anniversary in November 2022, and\u00a0JOHN\u00a0wanted to do something special to celebrate the album. Very sadly, Graeme Edge had passed away in 2021, but shortly before his passing, John and Graeme met and spent some special time together, and Graeme told John how he hoped John would continue on with the Moody Blues, and keep their music alive. Graeme had already recorded a special version of \u201cLate Lament\u201d for John, and John\u2019s great friend (and son-in-law) Jon Davison (of YES) had recorded \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d, and so the stage was set; John went into the studio and began work with his Musical Director, Alan Hewitt on the new show. John\u2019s hope being that he could honor his lost friends Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge, and his other bandmates Justin Hayward and Mike Pinder, but also reimagine it for today.The show, based around the simple tale of \u201ca day in the life of an everyday man,\u201d will highlight all that made\u00a0Days of Future Passed\u00a0the ground-breaking album that it was - arguably the start of Progressive Rock with its fusion of rock and symphonic sound. The show retains the core emotion of the original album and recreates its incredible orchestration, but at the same time it also brings in a modern feel thanks to the great strides in fidelity, and the maturity that comes with the passing of the years. Listen to \u201cNights in White Satin,\u201d \u201cTuesday Afternoon,\u201d \u201cPeak Hour,\u201d and more fill the room, and you\u2019ll be taken back to 1967, but at the same time, you\u2019ll hear what John has brought to this new version in his vocals, bass and harmonies, and how he sees the album 55 years later. In its own way, it can also be said to be a reflection of John\u2019s own life.",

        "description": "Join us at Herold's Pizza Oven in Sterling Plaza for another Paint Your Pet event raising funds for homeless pets in Central IL. PFS Shelter adopts pets of all ages to people 21+ with a special Pets for Seniors program matching senior citizens with senior pets for the happiness of both. We receive no government funding and rely on fun events like this to fund our work.\nWe are so excited to once again partner with amazing artist Megan Couri. Megan's artistic skills are the key to you leaving with an amazing piece of art featuring your own pet. She will sketch your pet based on the file you upload. Make sure the photo has only one pet and no people. After it's sketched, Megan will make it into a paint-by-number canvas and give you all the tools you need! This event is an awesome way to commemorate your animal or to paint it as a gift for someone else. All types of pets are welcome, even fish, birds, and reptiles! These events are always very fun. Food and drinks are available for purchase at Herold's. Make sure to purchase your tickets now, as the event will sell out! You do have to purchase each canvas individually. If you are buying multiples, you'll have to check out with each one on its own so the photos match up.",

Thought unsinkable, this man-made, historical feat carried the individual stories of her passengers and crew. Discover the people aboard The Titanic with characters from all backgrounds and walks of life with joys and sorrows, pleasure and pain, some survived, but many perished. This Tony Award-winning Broadway musical features an epic score, live orchestra, and an ensemble cast that can double/triple roles if needed. This scaled down production uses 20 actors playing all of the roles, an abstract set design, projections of the actual ship and passengers, and new orchestrations designed to make the score sound as if it was being played by the ship's band. Material that had been previously cut from the original Broadway production was put back into the show, and existing material was reordered and reassigned.",

The group signed a record contract with Atlantic Records, recorded one album, and opened for big names like Queen, Meat Loaf, Ted Nugent, and AC/DC. John Bonham, Jason's dad, died in 1980, but Jason, who has marked a few places in music history himself, has stepped in from time to time to help keep his father's memory alive.In 1988, Jason took his father's spot in the televised, first-ever Led Zeppelin reunion at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, which included Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones. Later that year, he went on to tour with Page and recorded the album Outrider with him.\nOn December 10th, 2007, Jason played drums in the most anticipated concert of all time - the Led Zeppelin reunion at London's O2 arena with surviving members Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant.",

Sophisticated, suave with a good dash of mischief, this hysterical comedy features a delightfully jazzy score by David Yazbek (The Full Monty) and was nominated for a staggering eleven Tony Awards.Lawrence Jameson makes his lavish living by talking rich ladies out of their money. Freddy Benson more humbly swindles women by waking their compassion with fabricated stories about his grandmother's failing health. After meeting on a train, they attempt to work together, only to find that this small French town isn't big enough for the two of them. They agree on a settlement: the first one to extract $50,000 from a young female target, heiress, Christine Colgate, wins, and the other must leave town. A hilarious battle of cons ensues that will keep audiences laughing, humming and guessing to the end!",

        "description": "Nikki Glaser is one of the funniest female voices in comedy today. For over a decade at clubs across the country, and as the host of three hit podcasts, she has been honing her shockingly- honest, no-holds barred style of comedy. Her brand new daily show, \u201cThe Nikki Glaser Podcast,\u201d launched March 2021 through iHeartMedia. It is a daily companion podcast that is peppered with Glaser\u2019s sense of humor and honesty to help keep listeners sane, well-informed and laughing through life.\nPreviously, Nikki hosted, co-created and executive produced the critically-acclaimed and daring comedic show, NOT SAFE WITH NIKKI GLASER, for Comedy Central and NIKKI & SARA LIVE for MTV.\nNikki has multiple stand-up specials and late-night tv appearances in which she jokes about her most humiliating moments as a woman in the modern world. Nikki\u2019s past and current struggles with anorexia, depression, and anxiety are fair game in both her stand-up, and in in-depth interviews with THE HOWARD STERN SHOW, WTF WITH MARC MARON and JOE ROGAN. She has become a complete open book on mic - and not just for the laughs, she\u2019s also adamant on being the empowering voice for women that she yearned for as a young, confused, adolescent herself.",

        "description": "The\u00a0Black Violin Experience\u00a0Tour showcases the two-time Grammy nominated duo Black Violin, brought to life by Kev Marcus and Wil Baptiste, invoking a mystifying musical fusion of exquisite classical sounds and exhilarating hip-hop beats. A concert performance that boldly merges centuries of music and unites audiences with a message of hope and possibility. Fans can expect to be immersed in a sound that transcends categories and celebrates ingenuity and ambition, proving anything is possible.\nOn stage, Kev Marcus gives an electrifying violin performance along with Wil Baptiste\u2019s magnetizing viola and vocal performance. Joining them are Nat Stokes on drums, DJ SPS on the turntable, and Liston Gregory on keys. Together they are reconceptualizing what a violin concert looks and sounds like, building bridges to a place where Mozart, Marvin Gaye and Kendrick Lamar harmoniously coexist. Black Violin invites you to think outside of the box.\nListen to\u00a0Take the Stairs\u00a0Here:\u00a0https://orcd.co/takethestairs\nFor more information about Black Violin visit:\u00a0http://blackviolin.net",

Last year he also was honored with the cover of Variety\u2019s comedy issue. The comedian has had the distinct honor of being one of the few to headline and sell-out Madison Square Garden in New York, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and The Sydney Opera House in Australia.\nOn TV, Iglesias is the star and executive producer of the Netflix original comedy series, Mr. Iglesias, which is currently streaming 3 seasons.
