# Vibemap Wordpress Blocks
 Draft blocks for Vibemap listings, events and maps scaffolded with Create Block tool.

This add on uses wp-scripts to create reactive blocks for editing and display.

## Development
You can use Local by Flywheel or wp-env to run and edit this plugin in a test enviornment.

With local you can create a symlink between this repositiory and a development/staging version of Wordpress. We have a few instances of WPEngine that can be used for this purpose.

## Installation on Wordpress
Create a .zip file of the Vibemap plugin. Then upload and activate it ot the Plugins page on Wordpress.
