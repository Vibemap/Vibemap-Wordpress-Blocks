        "description": "The Man in Chair, a musical theatre fan, greets the audience from his current-day NYC apartment, sharing that he is feeling a bit depressed. The best way to lift his mood, he decides, is to listen to his favorite cast album, The Drowsy Chaperone, a Jazz Age musical full of fun, clich\u00e9s, and dancing from the Roaring 20s. The characters come to life in the Man's apartment as he continues to narrate and interact with the cast and the audience. The show-within-a-show begins as guests arrive at the estate of Mrs. Tottendale for the imminent 1928 wedding of the famous Janet Van de Graaf to the wealthy Robert Martin. Janet's decision to marry Robert means that she will stop performing, of course, so the producer and gangster investors plot to stop the wedding. Other guests include the overworked Best Man, a Latin Lover, a daring aviatrix, and the Drowsy Chaperone, who continually sips from a flask, smuggled in during Prohibition. Hilarious situations, off and on again marriage plans, and a happy ending bring the Man in Chair his antidote to his blue mood, and he shares his glee with the audience.",

The show will also feature a first half set of Moody Blues' classics, including all of John's hits, \u201cRide My See-Saw\u201d, \u201cI'm Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)\u201d, \u201cIsn't Life Strange\u201d, to name just a few, plus tributes to all his band mates, as he continues in his quest to \u2018keep all the Moody Blues music alive'.Days of Future Passed\u00a0celebrated its 55th\u00a0Anniversary in November 2022, and\u00a0JOHN\u00a0wanted to do something special to celebrate the album. Very sadly, Graeme Edge had passed away in 2021, but shortly before his passing, John and Graeme met and spent some special time together, and Graeme told John how he hoped John would continue on with the Moody Blues, and keep their music alive. Graeme had already recorded a special version of \u201cLate Lament\u201d for John, and John's great friend (and son-in-law) Jon Davison (of YES) had recorded \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d, and so the stage was set; John went into the studio and began work with his Musical Director, Alan Hewitt on the new show. John's hope being that he could honor his lost friends Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge, and his other bandmates Justin Hayward and Mike Pinder, but also reimagine it for today.The show, based around the simple tale of \u201ca day in the life of an everyday man,\u201d will highlight all that made\u00a0Days of Future Passed\u00a0the ground-breaking album that it was - arguably the start of Progressive Rock with its fusion of rock and symphonic sound. The show retains the core emotion of the original album and recreates its incredible orchestration, but at the same time it also brings in a modern feel thanks to the great strides in fidelity, and the maturity that comes with the passing of the years. Listen to \u201cNights in White Satin,\u201d \u201cTuesday Afternoon,\u201d \u201cPeak Hour,\u201d and more fill the room, and you'll be taken back to 1967, but at the same time, you'll hear what John has brought to this new version in his vocals, bass and harmonies, and how he sees the album 55 years later. In its own way, it can also be said to be a reflection of John's own life.",

        "description": "Join us at Herold's Pizza Oven in Sterling Plaza for another Paint Your Pet event raising funds for homeless pets in Central IL. PFS Shelter adopts pets of all ages to people 21+ with a special Pets for Seniors program matching senior citizens with senior pets for the happiness of both. We receive no government funding and rely on fun events like this to fund our work.\nWe are so excited to once again partner with amazing artist Megan Couri. Megan's artistic skills are the key to you leaving with an amazing piece of art featuring your own pet. She will sketch your pet based on the file you upload. Make sure the photo has only one pet and no people. After it's sketched, Megan will make it into a paint-by-number canvas and give you all the tools you need! This event is an awesome way to commemorate your animal or to paint it as a gift for someone else. All types of pets are welcome, even fish, birds, and reptiles! These events are always very fun. Food and drinks are available for purchase at Herold's. Make sure to purchase your tickets now, as the event will sell out! You do have to purchase each canvas individually. If you are buying multiples, you'll have to check out with each one on its own so the photos match up.",

Thought unsinkable, this man-made, historical feat carried the individual stories of her passengers and crew. Discover the people aboard The Titanic with characters from all backgrounds and walks of life with joys and sorrows, pleasure and pain, some survived, but many perished. This Tony Award-winning Broadway musical features an epic score, live orchestra, and an ensemble cast that can double/triple roles if needed. This scaled down production uses 20 actors playing all of the roles, an abstract set design, projections of the actual ship and passengers, and new orchestrations designed to make the score sound as if it was being played by the ship's band. Material that had been previously cut from the original Broadway production was put back into the show, and existing material was reordered and reassigned.",

        "description": "At the age of only five, Jason could play the drums, at least a scaled-down set of them, with skill. When he was 17 he was a member of the band Air Race. The group signed a record contract with Atlantic Records, recorded one album, and opened for big names like Queen, Meat Loaf, Ted Nugent, and AC/DC. John Bonham, Jason's dad, died in 1980, but Jason, who has marked a few places in music history himself, has stepped in from time to time to help keep his father's memory alive.In 1988, Jason took his father's spot in the televised, first-ever Led Zeppelin reunion at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, which included Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones. Later that year, he went on to tour with Page and recorded the album Outrider with him.\nOn December 10th, 2007, Jason played drums in the most anticipated concert of all time - the Led Zeppelin reunion at London's O2 arena with surviving members Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant.",

Sophisticated, suave with a good dash of mischief, this hysterical comedy features a delightfully jazzy score by David Yazbek (The Full Monty) and was nominated for a staggering eleven Tony Awards.Lawrence Jameson makes his lavish living by talking rich ladies out of their money. Freddy Benson more humbly swindles women by waking their compassion with fabricated stories about his grandmother's failing health. After meeting on a train, they attempt to work together, only to find that this small French town isn't big enough for the two of them. They agree on a settlement: the first one to extract $50,000 from a young female target, heiress, Christine Colgate, wins, and the other must leave town. A hilarious battle of cons ensues that will keep audiences laughing, humming and guessing to the end!",

        "description": "Nikki Glaser is one of the funniest female voices in comedy today. For over a decade at clubs across the country, and as the host of three hit podcasts, she has been honing her shockingly- honest, no-holds barred style of comedy. Her brand new daily show, \u201cThe Nikki Glaser Podcast,\u201d launched March 2021 through iHeartMedia. It is a daily companion podcast that is peppered with Glaser's sense of humor and honesty to help keep listeners sane, well-informed and laughing through life.\nPreviously, Nikki hosted, co-created and executive produced the critically-acclaimed and daring comedic show, NOT SAFE WITH NIKKI GLASER, for Comedy Central and NIKKI & SARA LIVE for MTV.\nNikki has multiple stand-up specials and late-night tv appearances in which she jokes about her most humiliating moments as a woman in the modern world. Nikki's past and current struggles with anorexia, depression, and anxiety are fair game in both her stand-up, and in in-depth interviews with THE HOWARD STERN SHOW, WTF WITH MARC MARON and JOE ROGAN. She has become a complete open book on mic - and not just for the laughs, she's also adamant on being the empowering voice for women that she yearned for as a young, confused, adolescent herself.",

        "description": "The\u00a0Black Violin Experience\u00a0Tour showcases the two-time Grammy nominated duo Black Violin, brought to life by Kev Marcus and Wil Baptiste, invoking a mystifying musical fusion of exquisite classical sounds and exhilarating hip-hop beats. A concert performance that boldly merges centuries of music and unites audiences with a message of hope and possibility. Fans can expect to be immersed in a sound that transcends categories and celebrates ingenuity and ambition, proving anything is possible.\nOn stage, Kev Marcus gives an electrifying violin performance along with Wil Baptiste's magnetizing viola and vocal performance. Joining them are Nat Stokes on drums, DJ SPS on the turntable, and Liston Gregory on keys. Together they are reconceptualizing what a violin concert looks and sounds like, building bridges to a place where Mozart, Marvin Gaye and Kendrick Lamar harmoniously coexist. Black Violin invites you to think outside of the box.\nListen to\u00a0Take the Stairs\u00a0Here:\u00a0https://orcd.co/takethestairs\nFor more information about Black Violin visit:\u00a0http://blackviolin.net",

After being sold into slavery by his brothers, he ingratiates himself with Egyptian noble Potiphar, but ends up in jail after refusing the amorous advances of Potiphar's wife. While imprisoned, Joseph discovers his ability to interpret dreams, and he soon finds himself in front of the mighty but troubled, Elvis-inspired, Pharaoh. Joseph's solution to Egypt's famine elevates him to Pharaoh's right-hand man and reunites him with his family.\n\u00a0\nThe magical musical is full of catchy songs in a variety of styles, from a parody of French ballads (\u201cThose Canaan Days\u201d), to country-western (\u201cOne More Angel in Heaven\u201d) and calypso (\u201cBenjamin Calypso\u201d), along with the unforgettable classics \u201cAny Dream Will Do\u201d and \u201cClose Every Door.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDirected by Scott Moore",
